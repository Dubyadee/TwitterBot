# TwitterBot
The spots for the bots.Specifically for HyperDimensionalTourist @linkuistic.[Scope it out here!](https://twitter.com/linkuistic)
The simple idea is that an entity from an incomprehensible plane of reality is musing on it's experience with our world. Unfortunately Twitter doesn't take kindly to manipulated/glitch text, so the bot doesn't meet my aesthetic goal entirely. Because of this most of the responsibility for the vibe lies on the vocabulary being used, which is why it seems a bit sparse.
