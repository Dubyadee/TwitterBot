# TwitterBot
The spots for the bots.Specifically for HyperDimensionalTourist @linkuistic.[Scope it out here!](https://twitter.com/linkuistic)

The simple premise is contained within the bio. Unfortunately Twitter doesn't take kindly to manipulated/glitch text, so the bot doesn't meet my aesthetic goal entirely. Because of this most of the responsibility for the vibe lies on the vocabulary being used, which is why it seems a bit sparse.It is currently capable of 128,220 permutations. It has 2 and a half purposes. First is some mild comedy, the second is for linguistic intrigue. It inadvertently generates ideas that some people might find nifty for their own creative endeavors. The half purpose is that I want to fill it with some more obscure vocabulary, so that people are forced to look up definitions and consider how they apply to the permutation.
